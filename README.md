Repo for my interactive site prototype for the WGU class D479 User Experience Design

# Western Governor University Class D279 - User Interface Design assessment

Hi, I am Remy, a student of SWE at WGU. Here is lives the code for my assessment of class D479, UX Design.

## Description

This project involves redesigning a website for an Island called Taniti, a fictious island based on Tahiti, to enhance user experience, accessibility, and responsiveness. The redesign focuses on creating a user-centered interface that meets the needs travelers looking to vacation.

## Project Scenario

Paradigm Pet Professionals' current website was developed over a decade ago by an intern. The goal of this project is to redevelop the site into a responsive, user-centered experience that better serves its audience—primarily new and prospective pet owners in the U.S.

## Objectives

### **Part 1: Evaluation & Planning**

- Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project.

- Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents.

- Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website.

- Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers and then do the following:

- - 1. Summarize the qualitative feedback you received, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable and relevant to your design.
- - 2.  Explain how you will incorporate the feedback you received to improve your design.

- Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing. Your prototype must be submitted as a URL link.

- List five objective usability tasks you want users to test in Task 2 for your prototype.
